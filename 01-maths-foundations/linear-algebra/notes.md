# Linear Algebra for AI & Machine Learning

## Why Linear Algebra Matters in AI
Linear algebra is the backbone of machine learning and deep learning.
Data, model parameters, and transformations are all represented using vectors and matrices.

In simple terms:
- A **data point** = vector
- A **dataset** = matrix
- A **model** = matrix operations + optimization
